This is a Python program that allows you to play and solve Sudoku puzzles. It uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
3. Run the following command to start the game:

## How to Play the Game

The game is played by filling in the empty squares in a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. Each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The game starts with a partially filled grid, and your goal is to fill in the remaining squares.

To enter a digit in a square, click on the square and type the digit using your keyboard. You can also use the mouse to navigate the grid and select squares.

To solve the puzzle, click on the "Solve" button. The program will use an algorithm to fill in the remaining squares of the grid.

To start a new game, click on the "New Game" button. This will generate a new random puzzle.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library.
- Solver algorithm that uses a backtracking approach to fill in the empty squares of the grid.
- Ability to generate new random puzzles.
- Timer that keeps track of the elapsed time while playing the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
